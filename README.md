## Abstract
This project presents a hybrid encryption algorithm integrating multiple classical cryptographic techniques: Additive Cipher, Multiplicative Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, Transpositional Cipher, and a Custom Cipher introducing random characters for additional security. The multi-layered encryption significantly enhances security against brute-force attacks, frequency analysis, and cryptanalytic techniques.

The encryption sequence includes:
1. Additive Cipher
2. Multiplicative Cipher
3. Vigenere Cipher
4. Transposition Cipher
5. Additive Cipher (Reapplied)
6. Multiplicative Cipher (Reapplied)
7. Vigenere Cipher (Reapplied)
8. Custom Cipher (Adds Random Characters for Additional Security)

This implementation, written in Python, showcases enhanced key complexity and security resilience.

## Introduction
Cryptography is essential for securing digital communication. While modern encryption algorithms like AES and RSA dominate, lightweight cryptographic solutions remain crucial for embedded systems and constrained environments. This hybrid approach combines multiple classical techniques to enhance security while maintaining efficiency.

### Key Objectives:
- Improve security via substitution and transposition techniques.
- Increase key complexity to resist brute-force attacks.
- Develop a lightweight implementation suitable for constrained devices.

## Theoretical Foundations
### Multiplicative Cipher
Uses modular arithmetic:
```
C = (P * K2) mod 26
```
Where:
- `C` = cipher-text character index
- `P` = plain-text character index
- `K2` = key (must be co-prime with 26)

### Additive Cipher
A simple shift cipher:
```
C = (P + K1) mod 26
```
Where `K1` is an integer shift. Alone, it is weak but effective when layered.

### Vigenere Cipher
A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword:
```
Ci = (Pi + Ki) mod 26
```
Where `Ki` is derived from a repeating keyword, mitigating frequency analysis.

### Transposition Cipher
Rearranges text using a matrix-based transposition method to disrupt letter sequencing.

### Custom Cipher
Inserts random characters after each plaintext character to increase entropy and prevent frequency analysis.

Example transformation:
```
HELLO → Hxq Ebn Lzm Lkf Owp
```

## Algorithm Design
### Encryption Process
1. Convert plaintext to numerical indices.
2. Apply Additive Cipher.
3. Apply Multiplicative Cipher.
4. Apply Vigenere Cipher.
5. Perform Transposition.
6. Reapply Additive and Multiplicative Ciphers.
7. Introduce random noise characters.

### Decryption Process
1. Remove random noise characters.
2. Reverse Vigenere Cipher.
3. Reverse Multiplicative Cipher.
4. Reverse Additive Cipher.
5. Restore transposition structure.
6. Reverse all ciphers sequentially.

## Security Analysis
### Brute Force Resistance
The addition of random characters exponentially increases key space, making brute-force attacks impractical.

Key space calculation:
```
Total Keys = 50 * 24 * 676^L * 26^n
```

Example table:
| Keyword Length | Plaintext Length | Possible Keys | Time to Crack (1M keys/sec) |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 5            | 10             | 1.72 × 10³⁴  | 5.45 × 10²² years    |
| 10           | 10             | 2.04 × 10⁴¹  | 6.47 × 10²⁷ years    |
| 14           | 10             | 9.34 × 10⁴⁶  | 2.96 × 10³³ years    |

### Resistance to Frequency Analysis
- Vigenere Cipher distributes letter frequencies.
- Multiplicative & Additive Ciphers break direct character substitutions.
- Transposition Cipher shuffles character order.
- Random Characters introduce additional noise.

### Protection Against Cryptanalysis
- **Differential Cryptanalysis:** Layered encryption disrupts plaintext-ciphertext dependencies.
- **Linear Cryptanalysis:** No simple linear transformation exists across all encryption layers.
